Known Issues:

base.selenium_driver.sendKeys: 

Reports a failure to locate some elements on the “Create An Account” page (password, zip, mobile phone). 
The data is being filled in the text boxes, but the method reports a fail and logs a fail in the automation_log for these elements. Despite of that, the action is completed successfully and the test passes. 



Future Planned Improvements:

1. Refactor the tests so that there is one automated test per test scenario.
2. Improve framework architecture.
3. Improve framework logging.
4. Add comment for every method.
5. Move all locators in a single class
6. Secure login credentials
7. Use files to load test date from.
8. Use the screenshot method to provide more information when a test fails. 
9. Clean some errors in the terminal during execution.
10. Include more verification steps in the tests.
11. Include more negative tests.
12. Break down the tests so that one test does not take more than X sec.(consult with the team).
